Since the number of neutral/dissatisfied passengers are more than that of the satisfied passengers, the airline must work on improving their services.
- The airline should extend better amenities and services to Economy and Economy Plus, they can optimize seat configurations to provide more comfortable seating in Economy and Economy Plus, they should maximize legroom to improve passenger comfort during the flight. They can introduce additional amenities in Economy Plus, such as complimentary snacks, pillows, and blankets.
- The airline should set realistic expectations regarding the level of amenities and services available on shorter flights and clearly communicate it to passengers. They can provide pre-packaged amenities for passengers on shorter flights, such as snack, water, or a small comfort kit and minimize delays in responding to passenger requests. They can train cabin crew to efficiently manage shorter flights, ensuring they can deliver a high level of service within the compressed timeframe and emphasizing the importance of positive interactions with passengers during the brief journey.
- The airline can ensure the online booking platform is fully optimized for mobile devices, allowing users to book flights conveniently from their smartphones or tablets. They can simplify the booking flow to minimize the number of steps required to complete a reservation, implement a progress indicator to inform users about the stages of the booking process and provide a clear and immediate booking confirmation with all relevant details.

## Conclusion 
The airline should establish a continuous feedback loop by encouraging passengers to provide insights on their experiences. They should transparently communicate the changes and improvements being made based on customer feedback thereby building trust.
